Explain the key features of Python that make it a popular choice for programming.\n","\n","Answer 1:-\n","\n","(a) Easy to Code - Python is very easy to learn as compared to other languages like C, C++bold text, Javascript, Java, etc. It is very easy to code in the Python language and anybody can learn Python basics in a few hours or days. It is also a developer-friendly language.\n","\n","(b) Large Standard Library - Python has a large standard library that provides a rich set of modules and functions so you do not have to write your own code for every single thing. There are many libraries present in Python such as regular expressions, unit-testing, web browsers, etc.\n","\n","(c)  Frontend and backend development - With a new project py script, you can run and write Python codes in HTML with the help of some simple tags <py-script>, <py-env>, etc. This will help you do frontend development work in Python like javascript. Backend is the strong forte of Python it's extensively used for this work cause of its frameworks like Django and Flask.\n","\n","(d) Large Community Support - Python has gained popularity over the years. Our questions are constantly answered by the enormous StackOverflow community. These websites have already provided answers to many questions about Python, so Python users can consult them as needed.\n","\n","(e) Easy to Read - Learning Python is quite simple. As was already established, Python's syntax is really straightforward.
